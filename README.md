- use https://www.cplusplus.com/
- allowed to use the STD library
- namespace will always be ft and your containers will be tested using ft::< container >
- respect the structure of the reference container. If it’s missing a part of the Coplien form, do not implement it
- <container>.hpp for each container
- main.cpp which tests everything
- the member function get_allocator NO
- all other member functions and non-member overloads YES
- for non-member overloads, the keyword friend is allowed
- iterator system YES
- no more public functions than the ones offered in the standard containers (everything else must be private or protected)
